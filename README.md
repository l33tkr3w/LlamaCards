LlamaCards Web App
LlamaCards is a versatile web application that offers a dynamic node-based interface for real-time interaction with various language and vision models. The app allows users to create, connect, and manage cards representing different functionalities, making it a powerful tool for customizing and controlling interactions with models hosted within Ollama.

Features
Interactive Node-Based Interface:

Create, connect, and manage cards representing different functionalities.
Right-Click and select a card for easy customization layouts.
Real-Time Processing:

Concurrent processing of connected output cards.
Sequential processing of input cards to ensure data integrity.
Handles real-time updates and interactions using WebSockets.
Customizable Models:

Switch between different language and vision models with ease.
Supports a variety of models hosted within Ollama.
Embedding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

Embed text into a database for later retrieval.
Use the RAG card to combine prompts with stored data for enhanced responses.
Vision Card:

Supports image input from files or webcam streams.
Processes images and provides descriptions or analyses in real-time.
Repeater Card:

Automate sending prompts at specified intervals.
Ideal for recurring tasks or monitoring applications.
Comprehensive Logging:

Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring the applicationâ€™s performance.
Dynamic Connections:

Cards connected to multiple outputs process concurrently.
Cards with multiple input connections wait for all inputs to complete before processing.
User-Friendly Settings:

Customize default model, context size, and other settings directly from the web interface.
Save and load card layouts for easy reuse.
